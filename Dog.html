<h1>What are dogs?</h1>
<p>
    The Dog is a domestic animal. It is most of the often-used animal as a pet. People prefer to have a dog as a pet rather than any other animal. The dog serves its master selflessly. All that it wants in return is love and care of the owner.

    There are many breeds of dogs available in the world. Every breed has unique qualities and abilities different from the other. We can find the dogs all over the world. Some of them as a pet while some other wandering on the road. Some wild dogs live only in the forest.
