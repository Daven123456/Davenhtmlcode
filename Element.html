    By definition, a paragraph is a self-contained unit with a collection of sentences that are organized around a central topic or idea.

    Paragraphs are important when writing any piece. You begin with a letter, then a word, then your sentences, then the paragraph, then your essay, research paper, term paper, white paper, etc.
    
    As a fundamental rule, each paragraph must focus on just one idea, point, or main topic spread through its topic sentence, evidence/examples, and closing sentence.
    
    A solid paragraph ensures a flow of ideas in the readers' minds and improves the clarity of your writing. To write A+ grade essays, research papers, or even stories, you need to master the paragraph.
    
    To write that good paragraph, you need to master the four critical elements of paragraph writing and how each ensures that you end up with the best paragraphs.
    
    When planning or writing a paragraph, there are a few things you need to figure out:
    
    Purpose. Identify the purpose of the paragraph. Why are you writing it? Why is it important, given the thesis and or topic?
    Relevance. Ensure that the paragraph fits in the context of the topic and thesis. 
    Evidence. Ensure that the paragraph has adequate evidence that fortifies it or supports the thesis. This includes quotes, examples, and details, with relevant in-text citations where necessary.
    Analysis or Interpretation. Expound on the evidence to contextualize it to the thesis.
    Conclusion. A closing statement for the paragraph.
